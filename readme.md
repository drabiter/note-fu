# Myn

Myn is an open source simple notes application. It utilizes Dropbox service to store your note in form of serialized object rather plain text. Written in Java, it should run flawlessly on Windows, OSX, and Linux.
>Myn is still in early development, not tamed, and aggresive to human. I put no guarantee about using it :)
